# Exploring-NFL-Halftime-Shows-data
<p> Whether you like football or not, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes <a href="https://youtu.be/ZD1QrIe--_Y?t=14">riding giant mechanical tigers</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/mjrdywp5nyE?t=62">leaping from the roof of the stadium</a>.
In this notebook, we are going to find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. After exploring and cleaning our data, we are going to answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What are the most extreme game outcomes?</li>
    <li>How does the game affect television viewership?</li>
    <li>How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?</li>
    <li>Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?</li>
</ul>
<p> The dataset we will use was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_champions">game data</a>, one with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_television_ratings">TV data</a>, and one with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_halftime_shows">halftime musician data</a> for all 52 super Bowls through 2018.
